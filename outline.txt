Use replit, or any other IDE

Python time!
* Hello world! + (ask them to infer how print works)
* String escape characters
* Printing without a newline
* Comments

* Variables
* simple data types
* f-strings

* Arithmethic (however you spell that)

* Input
* try-except

More complicated stuff (tell them to use Google if unsure)
* if
* bool operators

* for
* range
* lists
* sorting

* while
* while True

* dicts
* sets
* tuples

* Functions

* Importing & pip!
* Libraries


Explain this with C programs
* Memory
* Main data types (int, float, bool, char)
* Arrays
* Normal arrays can't be extended!


Web stuff (have a Twitter app already set up)
HTML (don't teach them CSS)

TS (yes go right to TS, skip JS)
* Go through the Python section, but with JS syntax
* Using JS

The good part!
* Create django app
* Set up the app
* Routes
* Templates
* programmatic function in templates

* Auth -> custom user model

* Models
* Forms
* Model-forms

* Bootstrap ğŸš€

The bad part
